{"name":"Fuel","tagline":"FuelPHP is a simple, flexible, community driven PHP 5.3+ framework, based on the best ideas of other frameworks, with a fresh start!","body":"#Fuel\r\n\r\n* [Website](http://fuelphp.com/)\r\n* [Documentation](http://fuelphp.com/docs) and in its own [git repo](https://github.com/fuel/docs)\r\n* [Bugtracker & feature requests](http://dev.fuelphp.com)\r\n* [Forums](http://fuelphp.com/forums) for comments, discussion and community support\r\n* Version: 1.0.1\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nFuel is a fast, lightweight PHP 5.3 framework. In an age where frameworks are a dime a dozen, We believe that Fuel will stand out in the crowd.  It will do this by combining all the things you love about the great frameworks out there, while getting rid of the bad.\r\n\r\n##Development Team\r\n\r\n* Dan Horrigan - Lead Developer ([http://dhorrigan.com](http://dhorrigan.com))\r\n* Jelmer Schreuder - Senior Developer ([http://jelmerschreuder.nl/](http://jelmerschreuder.nl/))\r\n* Phil Sturgeon - Developer ([http://philsturgeon.co.uk](http://philsturgeon.co.uk))\r\n* Harro Verton - Developer ([http://wanwizard.eu/](http://wanwizard.eu/))\r\n\r\n##Downloading Fuel\r\n\r\nSince Fuel uses Submodules and since GitHub Downloads don't support submodules, do not download Fuel using the Downloads link here.\r\n\r\nWe will be putting a \"Download\" section on <http://fuelphp.com> soon.\r\n\r\n##Cloning Fuel\r\n\r\nFuel uses submodules for things like the **core** folder.  After you clone the repository you will need to init and update the submodules.\r\n\r\nHere is the basic usage:\r\n\r\n    git clone --recursive git://github.com/fuel/fuel.git\r\n\r\nThe above command is the same as running:\r\n\r\n    git clone git://github.com/fuel/fuel.git\r\n    cd fuel/\r\n    git submodule init\r\n    git submodule update\r\n\r\nYou can also shorten the last two commands to one:\r\n\r\n    git submodule update --init\r\n\r\n##Donate\r\n\r\n[Donate Here](http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/14124)\r\n\r\nAny donations would help support the framework and pay for software, development and hosting costs. We understand if you cannot, but greatly appreciate anything you can give.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
